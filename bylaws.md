# Bylaws
Elections shall proceed in accord with the single transferable voting method in order to achieve proportional representation, following the below tabulation procedure:
1. Prior to the election, a randomized alphanumeric ordering of all letters, numbers, and/or characters that may appear in the unique identifier of a candidate shall be created and published.
2. Each voter shall have one vote, ranking the candidates in order of descending preference, with the first rank representing the most preferred candidate.
    1. No candidate may be ranked repeatedly, and no two candidates may be ranked equally.
    2. A voter may rank as many or as few candidates as they would like.
    3. A voter may elect to designate "No Confidence" at any rank, which shall be treated as a candidate. No other candidates may be ranked after "No Confidence".
3. In each round of the election, vote counting shall start with the determination of each voterâ€™s preferred candidate according to their ballot, of the candidates remaining ("active candidates").
4. The threshold number of votes needed to be elect a candidate shall then be established ("Threshold"). The Threshold shall be calculated using the Droop quota, which is equal to the total value of votes cast in the round divided by the sum of one plus the number of seats remaining to be filled, plus one {[total vote value / (1 + number of seats)] + 1}.
5. If there are candidates whose vote totals meet or exceed the election Threshold, those candidates are considered elected ("elected candidates"). Votes exceeding the threshold are considered the candidate's "surplus". If there are no remaining vacant seats, the election is complete. Otherwise, the election continues.
6. For each elected candidate from (5), their vote surplus shall be redistributed in the following procedure:
    1. The fractional value of each vote to be redistributed is calculated by dividing the number of surplus votes for the candidate by the total votes received by the candidate and multiplying this by the current vote value of each ballot.
    2. This fractional value is transferred to to the next active candidate ranked on each ballot, or discarded if the ballot is contains no more active candidates ("exhausted ballot").
    3. Following the redistribution of surplus votes, the process of counting votes and distributing surplus votes of any winning candidates, as described in (3) through (6) above, is repeated. If no surplus votes were redistributed, the election shall proceed to (7).
7. The candidate with the least number of votes shall be removed from the election ("eliminated"), and the votes for that candidate shall be redistributed among the remaining candidates by next active choice ranked on the ballot, or discarded if the ballot is exhausted. 
    1. If there is a tie as to the candidate with the least number of votes, the entire tied set shall be eliminated if their combined vote count is less than the next-highest candidate.
    2. If there is still a tie, the candidate with the least number of votes in the previous round shall be eliminated. If the tie remains, this step is repeated for all previous rounds.
    3. If there is a tie in all previous rounds, the candidate with the least number of second-rank votes shall be eliminated. If the tie remains, this step is repeated for all next-ranks.
    4. If there is a tie in all previous rounds and next ranks, the candidate to be eliminated shall be randomly selected. The candidate ordered first by unique identifier when sorted according to the random alphanumeric created in (1) shall be eliminated. "No Confidence" is excluded from elimination by random selection.
8. This process of counting votes, distributing surplus votes of winning candidates, and eliminating losing candidates, as described in (3) through (7) above, is repeated until all seats are filled. 
    1. Should the number of remaining candidates be equal to or less than the number of remaining seats, then all those candidates who have received a higher percentage of votes than currently held by the "No Confidence" option shall win the remaining seats, with any remaining seats declared vacant.
